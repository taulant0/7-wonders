                The Taj Mahal, an exquisite example of Mughal architecture, is located in Agra, India. Commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, this stunning mausoleum was built in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away during childbirth. The Taj Mahal is renowned for its breathtaking white marble dome, which is set amidst lush gardens and surrounded by reflective pools. The intricate craftsmanship includes inlaid semi-precious stones and detailed carvings, showcasing the artistry of the era. The complex also features a mosque and a guesthouse, adding to its grandeur. The Taj Mahal is considered a symbol of eternal love and has been recognized for its architectural beauty and historical significance. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, it draws millions of visitors from around the world annually. Its designation as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World highlights its exceptional place in global cultural heritage, representing both Mughal artistry and enduring romance.</p>
